<h1 translate>About GymSystems</h1>

<p>
  <span translate>Gymsystems is an open-source system for managing TeamGymnastics tournaments. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span translate>It covers every aspect of hosting tournaments, from clubs communicating their list of gymnasts, the disciplines they'll compete in </span>
  <span translate>and any allergies they might have so that the organizers can better plan the menu - </span>
  <span translate>to publishing the scores for each teams participation, both online and on big screen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span translate>For information on how to use this system, if you want to host your own tournament, we keep a comprehensive user manual</span>
  <a translate href="https://github.com/OysteinAmundsen/gymsystems/wiki">here</a>
